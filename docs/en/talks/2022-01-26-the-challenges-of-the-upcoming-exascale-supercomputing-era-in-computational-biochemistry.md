  The beginning of the new era in supercomputers is expected in June 2022 with the arrival of the first batch of exascale supercomputers to the TOP500 list. Compared to existing petascale supercomputers, such computers require the use of more complex software models and algorithms to make optimal use of all available computing resources. In the last ten years, several partnerships and projects have been launched to develop and adapt software for the "exascale era", examples of which are the German Software for Exascale Computing (SPPEXA), the American Exascale Computing Project (ECP), the European European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuropHPC JU), and Croatian High performance scalable algorithms for future heterogeneous distributed computing systems (HybridScale). Specifically, in the SPPEXA programme, progress has been made with adapting many software packages for the expected exascale supercomputer architectures, including the popular open-source molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software GROMACS.

  The talk will cover what is known about the architectures of supercomputers that are expected to appear on the list during 2022 as well as hardware and software developments in the area of high performance computing by AMD, Intel, NVIDIA (Mellanox), ARM, and other companies. The specific focus will be on potential for further development of the molecular dynamics simulation algorithms in GROMACS and the expected impact of these developments on the larger ecosystem of computational biochemistry tools.

## Introduction

- a **supercomputer** is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer
    - also called high performance computer (HPC)
- measure: **floating-point operations per second** (FLOPS)
    - PC -> teraFLOPS; Bura -> 100 teraFLOPS
    - modern HPC -> 1 do 10 petaFLOPS, top 442 petaFLOPS
    - future exascalar HPC -> 1+ exaFLOPS
- nearly exponential growth of FLOPS over time (source: [Wikimedia Commons File:Supercomputers-history.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Supercomputers-history.svg))

## More heterogeneous architectures require complex programming models

- different types of accelerators
    - GPUs (half, single, double precision), TPUs/TCGPUs, FPGAs
    - in-network and in-storage computation (e.g. [Blue](https://store.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/store/?page=1&limit=9&locale=en-us&search=bluefield)[Field](https://www.pny.com/professional/explore-our-products/networking-solutions/nvidia-bluefield-data-processing-units) [DPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/))
- several projects to adjust existing software for the exascale era
    - Software for Exascale Computing (SPPEXA)
    - Exascale Computing Project (ECP)

## GROMEX

> The particle mesh Ewald method (PME, currently state of the art in molecular simulation) does not scale to large core counts as it suffers from a communication bottleneck, and does not treat titratable sites efficiently.
>
> The fast multipole method (FMM) will enable an efficient calculation of long-range interactions on massively parallel exascale computers, including alternative charge distributions representing various forms of titratable sites.

## Planned GROMACS developments (1/2)

- heterogeneous parallelism presently uses GPUs, could be expanded to also use DPUs
    - custom-silicon Anton 2 supercomputer's hardware and software architecture could be an inspiration
    - identification of packets that do not need to be delivered to all receivers and force reductions
    - NVIDIA already offers [free developer kits](https://developer.nvidia.com/converged-accelerator-developer-kit) to [interested parties](https://developer.nvidia.com/converged-accelerator-developer-kit-interest) for similar purposes

## Planned GROMACS developments (2/2)

- molecular dynamics simulations are periodic
- [simulation box types](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/algorithms/periodic-boundary-conditions.html#some-useful-box-types): cubic, rhombic dodecahedron
- present design and implementation of the fast multipole method only supports cubic boxes
    - it is possible to also support rhombic dodecahedron: ~30% less volume => ~30% less computation time per step required
- potentially apply for HrZZ UIP (if announced)

## Potential GROMACS developments

- Monte Carlo (Davide Mercadante, University of Auckland)
    - many efforts over the years, none with broad acceptance
    - should be rethought, and then designed and implemented from scratch with exascale in mind
- polarizable simulations using the classical Drude oscillator model (Justin Lemkul, Virginia Tech)
    - should be parallelized for multi-node execution
- other drug design tools such as Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics (Rebecca Wade, Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies and Daria Kokh, Cancer Registry of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg)

## Unified vision and specific applications

- high-throughput virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations could be offered as a service to Croatian, regional, and EU research groups
    - methods -> algorithms -> applications
- e.g. industry/academic group has a molecular target
    - RxDock, RDKit (HTVSDB, KNIME/Python automation): millions of molecules -> tens of molecules
    - GROMACS (KNIME/Python automation) -> tens of molecules -> several molecules
