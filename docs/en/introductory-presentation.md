## Exascale supercomputing is almost here

A **supercomputer** is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer, also called a **high performance computer** (HPC).

The performance is measured in terms of **floating-point operations per second** (FLOPS), where modern HPCs offer 1 to 10 petaFLOPS (top 442 petaFLOPS), while near-future **exascale supercomputers** will offer more than 1 exaFLOPS.

## More FLOPS means more complexity

Modern HPCs use different types of accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs, but also specialized hardware accelerators such as tensor processing units (TPUs) and in-network/in-storage computational hardware such as **data processing units** (DPUs).

**How to adapt the existing pile of scientific software for the near-future exascale supercomputing era?**

## Scientific software for exascale era

Our main interest is the research and development of algorithms in **scientific software** for **exascale supercomputers**.

The goal is to **design better-performing algorithms** and offer their implementations for academic and industrial use.

The specific focus in the present is the improvement of **molecular dynamics simulation algorithms** that enables efficient utilization of the **exascale HPC resources**.

## GROMACS for the exascale era

### Fast multipole method for general molecular dynamics simulation box types

The present design and implementation of the fast multipole method in GROMACS **only supports cubic** simulation boxes.

We are extending the method to also support approx. **30% smaller rhombic dodecahedron** simulation boxes, which would result in approx. **30% less computation time** per step required.

## GROMACS for the exascale era

### DPU offload of force reduction calculations in molecular dynamics simulations

The present implementation of accelerator offload in GROMACS uses CUDA or SYCL for force calculation on GPUs.

In this **NVIDIA-supported project**, our goal is to use the commercial off-the-shelf smart network cards with accelerators called **data processing units** (DPUs) for force reduction calculations.
