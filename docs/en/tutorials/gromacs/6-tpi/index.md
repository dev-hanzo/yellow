# GROMACS Tutorial 6 -- Excess Chemical Potential of Methane using Test Particle Insertion

In this tutorial, we'll be using test particle insertion (TPI) to calculate the excess
chemical potential of methane solvation in water. Most users are unaware that
GROMACS has a built-in method for running TPI. This tutorial will not be a
comprehensive discussion on the statistical mechanics of TPI, but will address
issues when needed. The user is encouraged to seek out scientific resources
regarding this method.

TPI involves perturbing some states to some other, very similar states. We will be
taking bulk water and inserting a methane particle and measuring the
potential energy change from this. There is a statistical mechanical
relationship between this change in potential energy and the excess chemical
potential. For us, state A is the bulk water system, and state B is the water
system with a methane.

With GROMACS you need to run state A as a normal MD simulation. We already did
this for our case of bulk water in [Tutorial 1](../1-tip4pew-water/index.md). We'll reuse the output trajectory
files for inserting the methane.

## Setup

### Create water system

Follow Tutorial 1 to run a system containing TIP4PEW water.

### Add test particle to topology file

Our original topology file just had water. In the new topology file, we simply
need to add 1 test particle, and it needs to be the last molecule in the system.
We'll use `opls_066` for the particle's atom type which is OPLS's united atom
methane. Here's what my final topology file looks like (the number of waters
will be different for your system):

```
#include "oplsaa.ff/forcefield.itp"
#include "oplsaa.ff/tip4pew.itp"

[ moleculetype ]
; Name          nrexcl
Methane         3

[ atoms ]
;   nr       type      resnr residue  atom   cgnr     charge       mass
     1       opls_066  1     CH4      C      1          0     16.043

[ System ]
Methane in water

[ Molecules ]
SOL               395
Methane           1
```

### Add test particle to gro file

You also need to add the test particle to the gro file. Simply edit `conf.gro`
(or any of the other `.gro` files uses) and add a line at the end containing the
test particle's position (right before the box coordinates). The line I added
looks like this:

```
396CH4      C 1581   0.000   0.000   0.000
```

The actual position doesn't matter; GROMACSS just wants a placeholder for the
test particle. Additionally, you need to add 1 to the total number of particles
in the system on the second line of the `.gro` file.

### Parameter files

We only need one parameter file for TPI. Simply copy `prd.mdp` from your bulk
water simulation and change `integrator` to `tpi`. You should change `nsteps` to
the number of insertions per frame that you want to attempt. I chose `100000`
steps for my simulation. You will also need
to change `cutoff-scheme` to `group`, since `Verlet` has not been implemented for
TPI.

## Simulation

For the simulation, we are just rerunning the bulk water simulation using the
saved trajectory file (which was named `prd.xtc` in the first tutorial). To do
this first run `grompp`:

``` shell
$ gmx grompp -f mdp/tpi.mdp -o tpi.tpr -po tpi.mdp -pp tpi.top -c conf.gro
```

Now use the `-rerun` flag with `mdrun`:

``` shell
$ gmx mdrun mdrun -s tpi.tpr -o tpi.trr -x tpi.xtc -c tpi.gro -e tpi.edr -g tpi.log -rerun prd.xtc
```

## Analysis

The log file, named `tpi.log` in this case, contains a line with the
average volume and the average excess chemical potential. My two lines looked
like this:

```
<V>  =  1.18704e+01 nm^3
<mu> =  8.81230e+00 kJ/mol
```

`<mu>` is output in kJ/mol, but if we convert it to kcal/mol we get 2.106
kcal/mol. This is in line with our results from the free energy of solvation
done in [Tutorial 4](../4-methane-fe/index.md)
using the lambda-coupling method where I got 2.289 kcal/mol. The difference can
be attributed to the usage of an all-atom model with the free energy of
solvation simulations and a united-atom model in this case.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we looked at how to use GROMACS to perform test particle
insertion in order to get the excess chemical potential of a united-atom OPLS
methane.
