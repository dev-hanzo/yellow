# GROMACS Tutorial 4 -- Methane Free Energy of Solvation

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to perform a free energy of solvation
simulation using GROMACS, as well as how to calculate the free energy change
using [MBAR](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2978177). As always, this
tutorial builds off of the previous ones, especially [Tutorial 1](../1-tip4pew-water/index.md)
and [Tutorial 2](../2-methane-in-water/index.md).

I recommend visiting the [Alchemistry](https://www.alchemistry.org/) website if
you are unfamiliar with free energy calculations. [This
page](https://www.alchemistry.org/wiki/Example:_Absolute_Solvation_Free_Energy)
in particular is relevant. This tutorial follows the direct calculation. State A
for us is a methane fully interacting in water. State B will be a methane with all
van der Waals and Coulomb interactions with the water turned off; the
methane can interact with itself and the water can interact with itself but not
with each other. It's as if we have taken the methane out of the water and put
it into a vacuum, while somewhere else we still have the water the methane was
in. We have 15 total states where we will be linearly turning off the
electrostatic interactions and then using a soft-core potential to turn off the
van der Waals interactions.

## Setup

### Box creation

Reuse the `methane.pdb` and `topol.top` files that we've been using so far for
the OPLS methane and TIP4PEW water. Remove any solvent from the `topol.top` file
(delete the last line which starts with `SOL`). Make sure that the name for the
methane under `[ moleculetype ]` is 'Methane' (no quotes), as well as under `[
molecules ]`. We'll be using one methane, so if you have more listed, change it
to 1 now.

This time we're using a different box type so that we won't have to use as much
water. We'll use a dodecahedron box at 1.2 nm out in each direction from the
methane. First, create the box:

``` shell
$ gmx editconf -f methane.pdb -bt dodec -d 1.2 -o box.gro
```

Now fill with solvent:

``` shell
$ gmx solvate -cs tip4p -cp box.gro -o conf.gro -p topol.top
```

### Parameter files

The parameter files we'll be using are almost exactly the same as previous
tutorials, except we're adding a free energy section in order to slowly turn off
our methane. Additionally, we need a parameter file for each state. We have
15 minimizations, 15 equilibrations, etc. But we'll use a script to simply
update the appropriate values in a template, so we actually only will have to
have one for each part of the simulation. At each state, we'll do our two
minimizations, equilibrate at NVT for 100 ps, equilibrate at NPT for 1 ns, and
then do a production run for 5 ns.

The files can be downloaded [here](mdp.tar.gz).

Here's an explanation of some of these new values:

| parameter | value | explanation |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `free-energy` | `yes` | Do a free energy simulation. |
| `init-lambda-state` | `MYLAMBDA` | The value I have in the files is not actually what will be present when we run the simulation. This is a placeholder for an integer number. We are simulating 15 different states, so this number will range from 0 through 14. Our script will replace it for each state. |
| `calc-lambda-neighbors` | `-1` | The delta H values will be written for each state. Necessary for MBAR. |
| `vdw-lambdas` | see file | We're turning off VDW at 0.1-lambda increments after electrostatics are off. init-lambda-state=0 corresponds to the first value in this array, init-lambda-state=1 the second, and so on. |
| `coul-lambdas` | see file | We're turning off electrostatics at 0.25-lambda increments first. Just like vdw-lambdas, the init-lambda-state indicates which column is being used. |
| `couple-moltype` | `Methane` | Matches the name of the `[ moleculetype ]` in the topology file that we are coupling/decoupling. |
| `couple-lambda0` | `vdw-q` | When lambda is 0 (state A) both VDW and electrostatics are completely on. |
| `couple-lambda1` | `none` | When lambda is 1 (state B) no nonbonded interations are on. |
| `couple-intramol` | `no` | Intramolecular terms are not turned off. Usually what you want so you don't have to run it again in vacuum. |
| `nstdhdl` | `100` | How often in steps we're outputting dHdlambda. |
| `sc-alpha` | `0.5` | We're using a soft-core potential for VDW. This parameter is a term in the soft-core function. See the manual. |
| `sc-power` | `1` | See above. |
| `sc-sigma` | `0.3` | See above. |
| `sc-coul` | `no` | Don't use soft-core for electrostatics. |

One last note on the parameter files: we're using the `sd` integrator, which
stands for stochastic dynamics. `sd` itself controls the temperature, so we're
no longer using Nose-Hoover. If you were to use `md` you would get a warning
that you may not be properly sampling the decoupled state.

## Simulation

As stated earlier we're actually running 15 simulations. To make this easier and
in order to avoid having 15 different mdp files as inputs, use the following
bash script to loop through and run each state:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

for ((i = 0 ; i < 15 ; i++)); do

    sed 's/MYLAMBDA/'$i'/g' mdp/min.mdp > grompp.mdp
    if [[ $i -eq 0 ]]; then
        gmx grompp -o min.$i.tpr -pp min.$i.top -po min.$i.mdp
    else
        gmx grompp -c prd.$(($i-1)).gro -o min.$i.tpr -pp min.$i.top -po min.$i.mdp
    fi
    gmx mdrun -s min.$i.tpr -o min.$i.trr -x min.$i.xtc -c min.$i.gro -e min.$i.edr -g min.$i.log

    sed 's/MYLAMBDA/'$i'/g' mdp/min2.mdp > grompp.mdp
    gmx grompp -o min2.$i.tpr -c min.$i.gro -pp min2.$i.top -po min2.$i.mdp -maxwarn 1
    gmx mdrun -s min2.$i.tpr -o min2.$i.trr -x min2.$i.xtc -c min2.$i.gro -e min2.$i.edr -g min2.$i.log

    sed 's/MYLAMBDA/'$i'/g' mdp/eql.mdp > grompp.mdp
    gmx grompp -o eql.$i.tpr -c min2.$i.gro -pp eql.$i.top -po eql.$i.mdp
    gmx mdrun -s eql.$i.tpr -o eql.$i.trr -x eql.$i.xtc -c eql.$i.gro -e eql.$i.edr -g eql.$i.log

    sed 's/MYLAMBDA/'$i'/g' mdp/eql2.mdp > grompp.mdp
    gmx grompp -o eql2.$i.tpr -c eql.$i.gro -pp eql2.$i.top -po eql2.$i.mdp
    gmx mdrun -s eql2.$i.tpr -o eql2.$i.trr -x eql2.$i.xtc -c eql2.$i.gro -e eql2.$i.edr -g eql2.$i.log

    sed 's/MYLAMBDA/'$i'/g' mdp/prd.mdp > grompp.mdp
    gmx grompp -o prd.$i.tpr -c eql2.$i.gro -pp prd.$i.top -po prd.$i.mdp
    gmx mdrun -s prd.$i.tpr -o prd.$i.trr -x prd.$i.xtc -c prd.$i.gro -e prd.$i.edr -g prd.$i.log

done
```

The script uses a for loop going from i=0 through i=14. In each iteration it
uses `sed` to find and replace the keyword `MYLAMBDA` I placed in our mdp file
template with the correct lambda state. It saves this file as `grompp.mdp` which
is the default file name that `gmx grompp` looks for. All of our output is
suffixed with the lambda state. Additionally all lambda states greater than 0
use the previous state's final structure file. This isn't entirely necessary
for methane decoupling, but it could possibly be beneficial in other systems.

Put the above in a script named `run`. The script assumes you have downloaded
and placed the mdp files in a subdirectory named `mdp`. Then do:

``` shell
$ chmod +x run
$ ./run
```

## Analysis

We'll be using MBAR, specifically the python implementation known as pymbar. The
[alchemical analysis](https://github.com/MobleyLab/alchemical-analysis) script
provides an easy way to perform the calculation and actually provides several
different methods with error analysis.

After downloading and installing the script, run it in the directory with the
results:

``` shell
$ alchemical_analysis -p prd. -u kcal
```

Your output should look something like this:

```

```

This is the free energy of removing a methane, so the free energy of solvation
is actually negative one times this, since it is the reverse process. Our result
of 2.289 kcal/mol is comparable to published figures. [In a paper that
simulated OPLS methane with TIP3P](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1587119),
they achieved a result of 2.44 kcal/mol. The difference can probably be
attributed to using a different water model.

Note that the script provides six different results from six different methods.
Some of these methods are better than others, but the fact that all six are
close to each other tells us we probably sampled enough states to get an
accurate number. MBAR is one of the better methods, although BAR and TI are good
as well. I reran the script to gather some more analysis:

``` shell
$ alchemical_analysis -p prd. -u kcal -g -f 20
```

Here is a visual comparison of the calculated value for each segment:

![Methods](dF_state.png)

I can see that one of the methods (DEXP) gets different results for
calculations between states 5 and 6 as well as between 6 and 7. I'm not too
concerned about this, since the other methods line up well and DEXP is not one
of the "better" methods.

And here is the `<dHdl>` curve:

![dHdl](dhdl_TI.png)

Here we are looking for places where the curvature is high. The curvature is
higher around states 10, 11, and 12. Depending on our application, we might want
to possibly sample more states in that area.

Lastly, here is a plot of the result calculated as a function of time, both
running the simulation forward and running it in reverse:

![dF_time](dF_t.png)

The point here is that we're looking to make sure that the simulation is
well-equilibrated; otherwise, the result will not be correct. If the curves were
flat for any significant portion of the first part of the plot, this would
indicate our system may not be well equilibrated before we started the
simulation. We could discard that non-equilibrated data and redo the
calculation.

There are a couple of other command-line flags you can use with the
`alchemical_analysis` script. Be sure to check out the homepage of the script and
the [paper on best practices in free energy analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-015-9840-9)
which goes much more into detail on these and other plots. I won't go into
detail about all the options here.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we performed a free energy simulation on methane in water. We
turned off electrostatics linearly first, and then we used a soft-core potential
to turn off the van der Waals interactions. The intramolecular interactions for
methane remained on, so it's as if we were removing the methane from the water
and placing it in a vacuum. Our result of 2.289 kcal /mol is comparable to
published results.
