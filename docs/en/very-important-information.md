### 50 Cent -- In da lab (In da club remake)

\[Intro\]  
Go, go, go, go, go, go  
Go shorty, it's your birthday  
We gonna code like it's your birthday  
We gonna hack OpenCV like it's your birthday  
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

\[Hook\]  
You can find me in the lab, PC full of deb  
Look Mami I got the X11 if you into RandR  
I'm into having binary, I ain't into making builds  
So come gimme a commit if you're into developing stuff

\[Verse 1\]  
When I pull git up front, you see the ROS on debs  
When I roll twenty pushes, it's twenty experiments in the lab  
Students heard I work with K, now they wanna show me tech  
When you sell like M, all the demoses, they wanna work  
But homie ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, A's up  
I see Z in the cut; hey colleague, apt-get install that software up  
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a developer or admin  
Been hit with a few null pointers but I don't walk with a segfault  
In the hood, in Vukovarska they sayin' L you hot  
They like me, I want them to love me like they love G  
But holla in AA them coworkers will tell you I'm loco  
And the plan is to put the research game in a choke hold  
I'm fully focused man, my coding on my mind  
Got a mill' LOC out the project and I'm still on the grind  
Now shorty said she feeling my code style, she feeling my execution flow  
Her girlfriend Dee Dee willin' to get bi and they ready to go

\[Hook\]  
You can find me in the lab, PC full of deb  
Look Mami I got the X11 if you into RandR  
I'm into having binary, I ain't into making builds  
So come gimme a commit if you're into developing stuff

\[Bridge\]  
My execution flow, my show brought me the dough  
That bought me all my fancy things  
My e-reader, my 90s car, my laptop, my jacket  
Look man I done PhD planned, and I ain't changed

\[Verse 2\]  
And you should love it way more than you hate it  
Friend you mad, I thought that you'd be happy I researched it  
I'm that cat in the box toasting to the Schrodinger experiment  
You that pathetic loser trying to break my code, right  
When my program get to compiling in the lab, it's on  
I point my GCC at your code, if it compiles, it's mine  
If the roof on fire, let the Kinect burn  
If you talkin' about money, homie I ain't concerned  
I'mma tell you what V told me  
Cuz, go ahead, switch the code style up  
If the researchers hate then let them hate and watch the journal papers pile up  
Or we can go upside your laptop with a pack of debs  
They know where we fuckin' be

\[Hook\]  
You can find me in the lab, PC full of deb  
Look Mami I got the X11 if you into RandR  
I'm into having binary, I ain't into making builds  
So come gimme a commit if you're into developing stuff

\[Outro\]  
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, man  
We in the lab all the time, man, it's about to pop off, man  
A-Unit

### LeToya feat. Bun B, Killa Kyleon & Slim Thug -- Eclipser (Swagger remake)

\[Intro: Slim Thug + LeToya\]  
Jartown (E-Town)

\[Killa Kyleon\]  
Run that back up in rsync again, wh-where checksums 're good again  
Mir-mirrorin Eclipse full ser-servin all those jars again  
I got that plugin, I use that menu, yeah that's why I code that code  
Let my down my click, pop up my window but on my app I solarize the dark  
I'm on that UI (movin slow), jammin that checkbox (my usage slow)  
Tippin 4, my buttons they glow, y'all make it rain, I make it snow  
Marketplace where I usually go, hit that solution I install straight in  
FTP yeah that's my protocol, don't do no eighties, my top be twenty-one

\[Verse 1: LeToya\]  
It's E-Town chick, you already know  
Call me Mrs. SWT cuz i'm makin windows  
My project bugless, Jenkins by my Git  
Richest text on my docs, Mylyn on my tasks

\[Hook: Slim Thug + LeToya\]  
I hear your programs talkin but they ain't fast enough  
It cost to be a dev but you ain't got enough  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
What you know about EMF rockin, webtools poppin  
Parallel Tools swipin, runnin everything you likin  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up

\[Verse 2: LeToya\]  
I'm back at it, been gone for a minute  
Busy feature planning and runnin my own business  
Had to shake a couple models, devs thought I was finished  
They say time is money so i'm codin every minute  
E-Town representer, yeah you already know  
You might spot me in the office packin MDT jars  
Draw it out in my Graphiti, to the webmaster I go  
If I ain't workin e4 PDE devs open my door

\[Hook: Slim Thug + LeToya\]  
I hear your programs talkin but they ain't fast enough  
It cost to be a dev but you ain't got enough  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
What you know about EMF rockin, webtools poppin  
Parallel Tools swipin, runnin everything you likin  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up

\[Verse 3: LeToya\]  
It's the B-I-R-T, everybody know  
Rockin big data with the Data Tools Platform  
Gotta be first, hello world class when i'm on the go  
Watch me implement this module CDT parsin in my IDE  
Now while you still on your Fortran Zeus i'm rockin Photran  
In my RHEL7 beta with your devs jelly  
And like JW say, 'let me upgrade ya'  
Well WB say 'eclipser up, baby'

\[Verse 4: Bun B\]  
You see my chain game is crazy and my piece game is playa  
My fit game is fiyah and my shoe game'll slay ya  
My wrist game ready and my whip game proper  
When I pull up on a bopper I'm a real showstopper  
Bun B, king of the trill, born and raised  
Down in Texas where these boys be runnin game for days  
If ya gal is in the building when I spot her I'ma snag her  
Better luck next time partner, step up your swagger

\[Hook: Slim Thug + LeToya\]  
I hear your programs talkin but they ain't fast enough  
It cost to be a dev but you ain't got enough  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
What you know about EMF rockin, webtools poppin  
Parallel Tools swipin, runnin everything you likin  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up  
Now get ya eclipser up, now get ya eclipser up

\[Outro: Bun B\]  
Man, get your swagger up, baby  
Especially if you coming to H-Town, baby  
Cause we really go down down here, know what I'm saying  
Get you money right, get your fly right, you know what I'm saying  
Step it up, baby, step it up, going down  
Bun B, 'till I call it on  
And H-Town fly, Le-T-O-Y-A, LeToy  
You already know, baby

### Pitbull feat. Marc Anthony -- Boot over me (Rain over me remake)

\[Chorus: Marc Anthony\]  
Girl my OS don't crash  
(Red Hat)  
I'm out my swap  
Let it boot over me  
(Fedora Worldwide)  
I'm mallocing so high  
Out of my swap  
(MARC Archive)  
So let it boot over me

Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me  
Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me

\[Verse 1: Pitbull\]  
3.0 is the new kernel  
Final is the new rawhide  
b43 is the new legacy  
Baby you're a developer  
Dale veterana, que tu sabe  
Mas de la cuenta, no te hagas  
Code me or better yet,  
Build me baby, yes, yes  
I'm buggy, I'mma make sure that your GDB feels useless baby  
No Valgrind reports, I like my programs sexy, classy, sassy  
Powerful yes, they love to get the malloc nasty, ow  
This ain't a terminal you'll see, you can do git blame on me  
Dale munequita ahora ahi, and let it boot over me

\[Chorus: Marc Anthony\]  
Girl my OS don't crash  
I'm out my swap  
Let it boot over me  
I'm mallocing so high  
Out of my swap  
So let it boot over me

Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me  
Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me

\[Verse 2: Pitbull\]  
3.0 is the new kernel  
And final is the new rawhide  
Fedora is the new majority, ya tu sabe  
Next step la casa blance  
No hay carro, no vamo en balsa  
Mami you know the drill, they will install what I want 'til they read the will  
I ain't try, I ain't trying to keep it real  
I'm trying to keep free disk space, that's for real  
Pero mira que tu estas buena, y mira que tu estas dura  
Baby no me hables mas, y tiramelo mami chula  
No games you'll see, you can do git blame on me  
Dale munequita ahora ahi, and let it boot over me

\[Chorus: Marc Anthony\]  
Girl my OS don't crash  
I'm out my swap  
Let it boot over me  
I'm mallocing so high  
Out of my swap  
So let it boot over me

Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me  
Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me

\[Bridge: Pitbull\]  
Fedora Worldwide, MARC Archive, tu sabe  
I was virtualizing her, she was booting on me  
Next thing you know, we were sharing the kernel tree  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I was virtualizing her, she was booting on me  
Next thing you know, we were sharing the kernel tree  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Boot over me

\[Chrous: Marc Anthony\]  
Girl my OS don't crash  
I'm out my swap  
Let it boot over me  
I'm mallocing so high  
Out of my swap  
So let it boot over me

Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me  
Ay ay ay  
Ay ay ay  
Let it boot over me

### Fedde le Grand & Nicky Romero feat. Matthew Koma -- Debs (Sparks remake)

\[Verse\]  
Listen to your apt for your ucf's sake  
You'll move a config  
I'll install all the packages that your fingers place  
Corrupt by the faulty mirrors  
I pull updates in, let me pull updates in so slow  
A new Debian Policy in contrib where we both cope  
I'll take you to reproducible builds just to let go  
Turn off your unattended-upgrades... (unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades, ...)

\[Bridge\]  
This is the time  
This is the time to turn off your unattended-upgrades  
This is the time to turn off your unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades  
Let me show you with your eyes closed, unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades  
What our apts both know, it's the time  
This is the time to turn off your unattended-upgrades

\[Verse\]  
Listen to your apt for your ucf's sake  
You'll move a config  
I'll install all the packages that your fingers type  
Corrupt by the faulty mirrors  
I pull updates in, let me pull updates in so slow  
A new Debian Policy in contrib where we both cope  
I'll take you to reproducible builds just to let go  
Turn off your unattended-upgrades... (unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades, ...)

\[Bridge\]  
This is the time  
This is the time to turn off your unattended-upgrades  
This is the time to turn off your unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades  
Let me show you with your eyes closed, unattended-upgrades, unattended-upgrades  
What our apts both know, it's the time  
This is the time to turn off your unattended-upgrades
